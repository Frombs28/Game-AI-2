Simon Hopkins: Worked on Pursue with Approach, Evade, Align, and Face

How Phases Work:

When the game begins, the different phases/scenes will play out based on a timer. This process starts automatically. You may press buttons 0-8 to play out any scene that you wish. However, the scenes will still play out on a timer; that is, they will always only be a certain length.

Scenes (in order):

Scene 0: Intelligent Dynamic Wander (Wolf)
Scene 1: Pursue/arrive and Evade with obstacle/collision avoidance
Scene 2: Pursue/arrive a still object with obstacle/collision avoidance
Scene 3: Pursue/arrive a still object with obstacle/collision avoidance
Scene 4: Pursue/arrive and Pursue/arrive with collision detection
Scene 5: 2 Pursue/arrive a still object with obstacle/collision avoidance and collision detection
Scene 6: Pursue/arrive a still object with obstacle/collision avoidance
Scene 7: Pursue/arrive a still object with obstacle/collision avoidance to the player
Scene 8: Nothing but text
